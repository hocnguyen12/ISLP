# Conceptual
## 1.
The p-values given in table 3.4 correspond to the null hypothesis of each coefficient of the model(`TV`, `radio` and `newspaper`)
Based on these p-values, we can expect `TV` and `radio` advertisement to have an effect on `sales`. Contrary to `newspaper` that seeems to have no effect on `sales`.

## 2.


## 3.
`salary` = 50 + 20 * GPA + 0.07 * IQ + 35 * Level + 0.01 * GPA * IQ - 10 * GPA * Level
a.
    i. False: \beta_3 = 35 -> if X_3 = 1 (college), the `salary` will be higher (of 35 on average) than if X_3 = 0
    ii. True
    iii. 

b. 
`salary` = 50 + 20 * 4 + 0.07 * 110 + 35 + 0.01 * 4 * 110 - 10 * 4
         = 137.1

c. No, we have to look at the p-value -> **justify**
